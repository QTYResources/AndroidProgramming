Source code samples for Android Programming: Pushing the Limits
===============================================================

Here you'll find the source code for most of the code samples in the book Android Programming: Pushing the Limits. Not all the samples are included here. For instance, I've left out those that are trivial and those that require some kind of code generation. 

For practical reasons, only the actual code is included here, not the entire Android Studio project. I've learned that most developers already have a complete Android project setup and it is easier to integrate pieces of code if it is not bundled in a complete project already.

However, I strongly recommend that you **manually write** the code yourself instead of copying these samples, as that is the best way to learn the APIs. 

These samples might (and probably do) contain bugs and errors. In that case, please report them to erik.hellman (at) hellsoft.se and I'll try to update these samples ASAP.

Good luck on your advanced Android development. :)
